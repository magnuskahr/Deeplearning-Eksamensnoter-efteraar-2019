# 5. Generative models 
_Lektion 9_


1. Explain what unsupervised learning is, motivate its use, and compare it with supervised learning
2. Describe the difference between a generative model and a discriminative model in overall terms
3. Know that a generative model tries to learn the distribution of the data itself, and intuitively explain why this is a more challenging than train a discriminative model
4. Explain how a traditional autoencoder (AE) works and know the meaning of related terms, like encoder, decoder, and latent/hidden representation
5. Know that traditional AEs are typically used for dimensionality reduction and feature learning
6. Know which loss functions are typically used for training AEs
7. Know the difference between an undercomplete and overcomplete AE
8. Explain what a stacked AE is, and intuitively explain why it performs better than a one-layer
AE
9. Know what latent interpolation is and mention examples of uses of it
10. Intuitively explain why traditional AEs tend to create gaps in the latent space representation
(makes the task easier for the decoder)
11. Mention regularization strategies that can be used in combination with AE
12. Explain what a Denoising AE is and how it works
13. Explain what a convolutional AE works and describe its overall architecture (especially
upsampling techniques)
14. Explain conceptually how variational AEs differ from traditional AEs, and why they tend to
learn smoother latent space representations
15. Explain the architecture of a AE (including latent space representation and sampling layer)
16. Motivate the use of the KL divergence term in variational AEs, and explain intuitively what
the effect of the KL term is
17. Mention examples of latent space arithmetic
18. Explain what a Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) does, and how it is designed (i.e.,
generator and discriminator)
19. Explain how a GAN is trained (including definition of loss functions)
20. Know what a Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) is and what the overall network architecture
looks like
21. Know conceptually what a Conditional GAN is.
