# ConvNet architectures 
_Lektion 7 og 10_

## Træning af convnets
### Filtre
- [ ] Explain in overall terms what the different layers in ConvNets learn (from simple features like “edges” or “blobs” to semantic features like “wheel” or “door”).

### Transfer learning
- [ ] Motivate the need for transfer learning and describe different use scenarios (1-4)
- [ ] Know the difference between the terms “pre-training” and “fine-tuning”

## AlexNet
- [ ] Describe in overall terms the architecture of AlexNet
- [ ] Describe the major differences between AlexNet and VGG net, and explain why VGG uses stacked convolutions with kernel size 3x3 instead of large filters of size, say 7x7

- [ ] Know how to calculate the output shape of a convolution layer, given input shape, kernel size, stride, zero padding, and number of filters

## GoogleNet
- [ ] Explain how 1x1 convolution can be used for dimensionality reduction (e.g., in GoogLeNet)
- [ ] Explain and motivate the architecture of the simple inception module
- [ ] Explain and motivate the use of 1x1 convolutions in the inception module
- [ ] Explain the role of global average pooling in GoogLeNet
- [ ] Explain the role of auxiliary classifiers in GoogLeNet

## Layer Activations
- [ ] Describe how to visualize layer activations, and what is typically observed
- [ ] Describe how to visualize layer filters and what to look for (smoothness)
- [ ] Describe how fully connected layers can be visualized with K-NN and what to look for (semantic similarity rather than pixel/color similarity)
- [ ] Explain conceptually how to visualize features using dimensionality reduction (including what t-SNE aims to do – but not necessarily how it does it...)

## Rekonstruktion
- [ ] Explain the overall concept of reconstruction-based visualization (optimization on image rather than network weights)
- [ ] Describe how “Inverting ConvNets” works and what it does, including what “content image” means
- [ ] Know what the reconstructions from different layers typically look like when inverting ConvNets
- [ ] Explain how reconstruction-based filter visualization works
- [ ] Describe what class-based reconstruction is, and how it works
